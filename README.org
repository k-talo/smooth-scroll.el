* smooth-scroll.el --- Minor mode for smooth scrolling and in-place scrolling.

** OVERVIEW

This library provides minor mode `smooth-scroll-mode' which adds
smooth scrolling feature to Emacs.


** INSTALLING

To install this library, save this file to a directory in your =load-path=
(you can view the current =load-path= using =C-h v load-path <RET>= within Emacs),
 then add the following line to your =.emacs= startup file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'smooth-scroll)
(smooth-scroll-mode t)
#+END_SRC


** USING

To toggle smooth scrolling feature, just type:

: M-x smooth-scroll-mode <RET>

while smooth scrolling feature is enabled, the string "SScr" will
be displayed on mode line.

Also check out the customization group by:

 : M-x customize-group <RET> smooth-scroll <RET>


** Additional commands provided by =smooth-scroll.el=.

This library provides commands that brings `in place scrolling'
feature, listed below:

- =scroll-up-1=
- =scroll-down-1=
- =scroll-left-1=
- =scroll-right-1=

Bind these commands to any key you like for your convenience.

Keymap example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key [(control  down)]  'scroll-up-1)
(global-set-key [(control  up)]    'scroll-down-1)
(global-set-key [(control  left)]  'scroll-right-1)
(global-set-key [(control  right)] 'scroll-left-1)
#+END_SRC

NOTE: Keys described above won't work on non window-system.


**  KNOWN PROBLEMS

 - The speed of smooth scrolling is very slow on `Carbon Emacs'
   and `Cocoa Emacs' on Mac OS X. If you want to use smooth scrolling
   feature comfortably on these Emacsen, set large number
   (e.g. 4, 6 or 8) to the variable =smooth-scroll/vscroll-step-size= 
   and =smooth-scroll/hscroll-step-size=.

 - =scroll-left-1= and =scroll-right-1= may not work properly
   when the =smooth-scroll-mode= is turned off, due to the behavior
   of original =scroll-left= and =scroll-right= functions.
